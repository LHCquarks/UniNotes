There are many "conjugate" variables for which the prepossession to which you can measure both are substantially limited by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$. These are:
- $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p_x \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$ 
- $\Delta y \cdot \Delta p_y \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$ 
- $\Delta z \cdot \Delta p_z \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$ 
- $\Delta t \cdot \Delta E \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$
