The UV catastrophe was a issue with classical mechanics where theory predicted that an object of high temperature (a black body) would radiate an infinite amount of high frequency light which was obviously not observed. This was later solved by the [[Quantum Light|quantisation of light]].

### Classical mechanics
After a lot of funky maths found in the 10:05 lecture on Friday 25 July we get that classical mechanics predicts $B(f, T) = \frac{2kT}{c^2}f^2$
This is so obviously wrong!
### The problem
We consider all nodes as having an equal contribution to the temperature

### The fix
In Quantum mechanics we get that the average energy of a photon is
$$\bar{E} = \frac{hf}{e^{hf/kT}-1}$$
which gives that $$B(f,T) = \frac{2hf^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{kf/kT}-1}$$
the correct distribution.
