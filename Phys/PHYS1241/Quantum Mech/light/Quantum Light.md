In 1905, in response to max plank's solution to the [[UV catastrophe]] Einstein proposed that light was infact a particle not a [[EM waves|EM wave]]. This theory was proven by the [[Photoelectric Effect]].

## Properties
- The energy of a light ray is given by $E = hf$
- Light is made up of discrete packets called photons
- Light has momentum $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$
