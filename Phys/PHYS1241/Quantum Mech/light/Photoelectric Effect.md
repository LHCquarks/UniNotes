The photoelectric effect was an experiment crucial to the development of quantum mechanics.
## The Setup

In the photoelectric effect we have a metal sheet which we indent light onto ejecting electrons from the material. Once the electrons are ejected they are slowed down by an electric field and then pushed through a circuit which is measured.

## The result
It was found that the voltage of the current does not change with the intensity of the light released indicating that light delivers it's energy to the electrons in discrete packets ([[quanta]]). This discovery experimentally showed [[Quantum Light|light is a particle]].

## Cutoff frequencies
Experiment observed that as you decrease the light of the wave the voltage decreases linearly until it hits zero and no current is observed for any lower frequencies of light. This point is called the **cutoff frequency**. ![[Pasted image 20250808143729.png]]
It was found that the equation this follows is $$hf = K_{max} + \Phi$$ where:
- $hf$ is the energy of the light
- $K_{max}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons
- $\Phi$ is the work function describing how much energy is required for an electron to leave the material

When a voltage is applied to the system we can inspect the cutoff frequency with the equation $$hf = V_{stop} + \Phi.$$
