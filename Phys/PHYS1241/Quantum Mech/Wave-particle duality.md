As it turns out, every particle is a wave and vice versa!
This was first discovered due to experiments involving light. Whilst some experiments such as the [[Photoelectric Effect]] proved light was a particle, other experiments such as [[Young's Interference Experiment]] proved light was a wave. The only way for these both to be true is if light is both a particle and a wave!
What is the new interpretation of light:
- A normalised Electric field acts as a probability distribution for the particle

## For other particles
De Broglie decided if light is both a wave and a particle then so should everything else so he made the educated guess that the wavelength of a particle is $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$. This was proven true for every particle by sending different particles through a double slit.
