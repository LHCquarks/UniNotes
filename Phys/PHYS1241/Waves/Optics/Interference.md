Interference occurs when two or more rays of light become out of phase with each other and thus sum to equal zero effectively cancelling each other out. This property is responsible for many weird phenomena such as:
- [[Young's Interference Experiment|The double slit]]
- [[Single Slit Diffraction|The single slit]]
- [[Thin film diffraction]]
- [[Michelson interferometer]]
- [[Circular aperture]]
- [[Diffraction gratings]]
- [[Bragg's law]]
