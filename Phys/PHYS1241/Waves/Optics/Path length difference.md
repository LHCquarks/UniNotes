Path length difference also expressed as $\Delta PLD$ is a measure for how much out of phase two waves are and is usually an intermediate step to find the difference in phase of two waves.
## Geometric PLD
Sometimes PLD occur due to light rays taking different paths to a point and as such having different PLD. To find this the PLD is simply the difference in distances each ray travelled.
## Optical PLD
Optical PLD occurs when two rays are travelling in two different mediums and thus they have different wavelengths for the duration whilst they are in the two mediums.
The Optical PLD for a ray compared to one in air that has travelled the same difference is
$\Delta PLD = nL$.
For two light rays, simply compare both to a ray in air and then combine them giving
$\Delta PLD = |n_1L - n_2L| = L|n_1 - n_2|$
