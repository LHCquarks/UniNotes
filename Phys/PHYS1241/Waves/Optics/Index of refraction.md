The index of refraction of a material is a number which describes how light's velocity changes as it moves through a medium. 
## Derivation
For a medium $\epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0$ and $\mu = \mu_r \mu_0$ where $\epsilon_r$ and $\mu_r$ describe the effects of the medium on the permeability and permittivity of the electric and magnetic fields.
We know that the speed of light is $v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}$ hence we get that $v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r}}$. Thus we define $n = \sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r}$ so that $v = \frac{c}{n}$ 

## Chromatic Dispersion
Interestingly, the index of refraction of a material is dependent on the wavelength of light. The index of refraction often decreases as wavelength increases.
This difference in refractive indexes results in differing exiting angles of light by [[Snell's law]] hence leading to white light being split up into it's constituent colours  after being passed through a transparent material like a prism.
