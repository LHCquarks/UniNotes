Diffraction gratings are films with many slits on them.
They behave the same as a [[Young's Interference Experiment|double slit]] with one key difference which makes them ideal for performing experiments with. When using them the Intensity drops off much faster than a double slit experiment with formula for the 'half width' of each peak being $Ndsin(\Delta\theta_{hw})= \lambda$ ![[Pasted image 20250808123632.png]]
and thus $\Delta \theta_{hw} \approx \frac{\lambda}{Nd}$ 

## Diffraction grating spectroscopy
For spectrometers this formula changes to become $\Delta \theta_{hw}=\frac{\lambda}{Ndcos(\theta)}$. ![[Pasted image 20250808124122.png]]
Spectrometers have two key statistics being:
- Dispersion
- Resolving Power 
### Dispersion
Dispersion is a measure of far away the maxima of two wavelengths are and uses the formula $$D=\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta \lambda}$$
where:
- $D$ is the dispersion
- $\Delta \theta$ is the angular separation of maxima
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength difference

For a normal grating this works out to be $$D = \frac{m}{dcos(\theta)}$$
where:
- $m$ is the mth order maximum
- $d$ is the distance between slits
- $\theta$ is the angle off the vertical

### Resolving Power
Resolving power is a measure of how distinct each maxima is and had the formula $$R = \frac{\lambda_{avg}}{\Delta \lambda}$$
where:
- $\Delta \lambda$ is the minimum wave length difference that can be resolved
- $\lambda_{avg}$ is the average wavelength in the minimum resolving band

For a normal grating this works out to be $$R = Nm$$
where:
- $N$ is the number of slits in the grating
- $m$ is the mth maxima
