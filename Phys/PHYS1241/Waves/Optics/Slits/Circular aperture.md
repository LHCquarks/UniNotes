When working with a circular slit we get an intensity formula of $$
I(r) = I_m\frac{J_1(\frac{krd}{2D})}{\frac{krd}{2D}}
$$
where:
- $I_m$ is the max intensity
- $k$ is the wave vector $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
- $r$ is the radius from the centre of the screen
- $d$ is the diameter of the aperture
- $D$ is the distance of the plate from the slit
- $J_1$ is a first kind bessel function of order 1

Using $sin(\theta) = \frac{r}{D}$ we get that the first minimum occurs when $sin(\theta) = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}$.

## Rayleigh's criterion
Rayleigh's criteria says that the minimum resolvable angular separation of two points occurs when the central maximum of one point is in the first minimum of another point thus the minimum resolving angle of circular aperture is $\theta_r = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}$.
