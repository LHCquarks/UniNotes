Bragg's law describes the interference pattern off of a crystal lattice. Using Bragg's law x-ray crystallography can be used to determine the structure of a crystal.

We consider a cubic crystal lattice and indent light at an angle of theta to the crystal's surface like so

where $d$ is the separation between nodes in the lattice and $\theta$ is the angle the light was indented. Thus we get the path length difference of the two rays is $\Delta L = 2dsin(\theta)$ and so we get bright spots when $2dsin(\theta) = m\lambda$.
