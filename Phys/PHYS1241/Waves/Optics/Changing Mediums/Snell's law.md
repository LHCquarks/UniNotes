For light entering a new medium Snell's law states that $n_1sin(\theta_1) = n_2sin(\theta_2)$ where
- $n_1$ is the [[Index of refraction]] of the old medium
- $\theta_1$ is the angle the light ray makes with the normal to the surface
- $n_2$ is the [[Index of refraction]] of the new medium
- $\theta_2$ is the angle the light ray makes with the normal pointing into the new material

In general if a ray of light is moving to a medium with a higher refractive index then the light ray will bend to be closer to the normal and vice versa.
