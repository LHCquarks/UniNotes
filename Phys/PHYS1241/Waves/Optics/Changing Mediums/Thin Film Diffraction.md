When light is directed at a thin membrane which has a thickness on the order of it's wave length we get special regions where light [[Interference|interferes]] with itself to cancel out and produce an array of colours:

## Theory
When observing a film straight on we get:

This uses the fact that light reflected from a surface with a higher [[Index of refraction|refractive index]] picks up a phase shift.

## Examples
- The colours on bubbles are produced due to this effect
- Oil films also produce these colours
