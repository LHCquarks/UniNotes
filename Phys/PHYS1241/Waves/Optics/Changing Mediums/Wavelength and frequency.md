When light enters a medium it's speed will change according to it's [[Index of refraction|refractive index]] leading to some of it's properties to change. When light enters a new medium only it's wavelength changes and it's frequency stays the same! In fact we get that:
$$ \begin{align}
v &= \frac{c}{n} \\
\lambda_{new} f &= \frac{c}{n} \\
n\lambda_{new} f &= \lambda_{old} f \\
\lambda_{new} &= \frac{\lambda_{old}}{n}
\end{align}
$$
