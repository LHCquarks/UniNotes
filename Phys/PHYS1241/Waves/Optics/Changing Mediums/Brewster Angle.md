When light is partially reflected off a surface it becomes polarised at a very specific angle called the Brewster Angle $\theta_b$.

This angle had the relation that $\theta_b + \theta_r = \frac{\pi}{2}$ which using [[Snell's law]] gives $$
\begin{align}
n_1sin(\theta_b) &= n_2sin(\theta_r) \\
n_1sin(\theta_b) &= n_2sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta_b\right) \\
n_1sin(\theta_b) &= n_2cos(\theta_b) \\
tan(\theta_b) &= \frac{n_2}{n_1} \\
\theta_b &= tan^{-1}\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)
\end{align}
