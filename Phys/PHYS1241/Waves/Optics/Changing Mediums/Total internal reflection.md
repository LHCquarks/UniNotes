When light is moving from a material with a high [[Index of refraction|refractive index]] to one with a low [[Index of refraction|refractive index]] there exists a critical angle $\theta_c$ such that for an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle the light is reflected rather than transmitted. This is due to [[Snell's law]] as we get: 
$$
\begin{align}
n_1sin(\theta_1) &= n_2sin(\theta_2) \\
\frac{n_1}{n_2}sin(\theta_1) &= sin(\theta_2) \\
n_1 \ge n_2 &, 0 \le sin(\theta_1) \le 1 \\
\implies \exists \ \theta_c: \forall \theta > \theta_c &,  \frac{n_1}{n_2}sin(\theta) > 1 \\
\implies sin(\theta_2) &> 1
\end{align}$$which obviously can not happen so we have a contradiction! This is the point for which [[Snell's law]] breaks down. Instead we just get total internal reflection.

## How to find the critical angle
The critical angle occurs when $\frac{n_1}{n_2}sin(\theta_1) = 1$ so we get that $\theta_c = sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2}{n_1})$
