The method of phasors can be used to easily sum up multiple waves to find the intensity of the total wave.
Considering just the electric field of a EM wave we can write $E_i = E_0sin(\omega t + \Phi_i)$. Now considering this as the vertical part of a vector with a magnitude of $E_0$ and a angle of $\omega t + \Phi_i$we can draw a diagram for the vector addition of the waves and use geometry to find the resultant electric field.

Using geometry for this example we get that due to the triangle being isosceles the far angle is $\beta$ and thus the middle angle is $180 - 2\beta$  we can use this to show that $\Phi = 2\beta$. 
Further, we split the triangle down it's centre to determine $$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}E &= E_0cos(\beta) \\
E &= 2E_0cos\left(\frac{\Phi}{2}\right).
\end{align}
