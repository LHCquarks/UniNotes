Light has a small amount of momentum, hence when light reflects off or is absorbed by a surface it causes the surface to gain / lose momentum. 
## Total absorption
From the [[Mass Energy Relation]] we get that $E^2 = |\vec{p}|^2c^2 + m^2c^4$. Because $m = 0$ this reduces to $E = |\vec{p}|c$ . Substituting $E = IA$ we get that $IA = |\vec{p}|c$ which means that there is a momentum transfer of $\Delta p = \frac{IA}{c}\Delta t$. Using $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$ we get that $F = \frac{IA}{c}$ which means the pressure is $P = \frac{I}{c}$. 
## Reflection
Similar to total absorption we find that $\Delta p = \frac{IA}{c}\Delta t$, only this time, there is double the momentum transfer due to the light bouncing back of with the same momentum in the opposite direction. Thus we get $P = \frac{2I}{c}$.
