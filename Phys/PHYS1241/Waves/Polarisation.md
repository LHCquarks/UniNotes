Because light is made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields the directions of these oscillation can play a role in how light moves. When light oscillates in the same direction is called polarised.

## Polarisers

Polarisers are materials that polarise light. Often they take the form of sheets that only allow electric fields that oscillate in a single direction thereby filtering out any non-polarised light.
Unpolarised light that enters this filter will have it's $E$ field component filtered to only be in the allowed direction so we get that $E_1 = E_0cos(\theta)$ where:
- $\theta$ is the angle the electric field is off the polariser's direction
- $E_0$ is the old electric field strength
- $E_1$ is the new electric field strength

When considering the intensity change we have to square the electric fields thus we get the formula $$I_1 = I_0 cos^2(\theta).$$
