Electro-Magnetic waves are a consequence of [[Maxwell's Equations]] and are oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate perpendicular the the wave's motion.

## Derivation

## Properties
- The Electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and the direction of propagation as shown: ![[Pasted image 20250806115013.png]]
	Note: $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{B}$ is not actually taking up space, it is just vectors 
- $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are sinusoidal and in phase
- $|\vec{E}| = c|\vec{B}|$ 
- $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ points in the direction of propagation and describes the intensity of the wave over time 
	- $\frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec{E}\times\vec{B} = \vec{S}$  the Poynting vector
	- Hence $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec{E}\times\vec{B}$ 
- The intensity of a wave is $I = S_{avg} = \frac{\vec{E}_{max}^2}{2\mu_0c} = \frac{\vec{B}_{max}^2c}{2\mu_0}$ which is a measure of the power transmitted per unit area and is the average magnitude of the Poynting vector
- The power of a wave is $P = IA$ where $A$ is the area receiving the power
- $hf = v = c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}$ 
- Like all other waves EM waves have a [[#Phase]]
- Light has a [[Polarisation]]
## The spectrum
Different wavelengths of light are organised into the different categories below:

## Phase
### Definition
The phase of a light ray is a measure of how far a light ray is from it's maximum intensity. 
Taking an EM wave to have the equation $E = E_{max}sin(\Phi)$ we get the phase $\Phi$ as a function of position and time.
### Cancelling
Most questions involving phase asks for what phases do waves cancel each other out or constructively interfere with each other. 
- Waves cancel each other out when there phase offset is $\Delta \Phi = \pi$ 
- Waves constructively interfere with each other when $\Delta \Phi = 2\pi$

## Coherence
Light is considered coherent if it has the same phase difference.
### Examples
- Sunlight is not coherent
- A lazer is coherent
- Sunlight that has been passed through a [[Single Slit Diffraction|single slit]] is coherent
