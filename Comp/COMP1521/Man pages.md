## What it is
Man is a linux command that pulls up the manual page for a tool.

## Sections
To select which section you want you put the number directly after the man command:
```Bash
$ man 1 cp
```
We do this because there may be duplicate entries

The section a entry is in is displayed in the top left corner of the man page![[Pasted image 20250915114438.png]]
