## C types
Floating point numbers are designed to store decimal numbers.

We can use the types:
- `float` - 32 bits
- `double` - 64 bits
- `long double` - 128 bits

C stores decimals as doubles
## In memory


## Printing
We can print with the following tags:

| Tag   | style                                         |
