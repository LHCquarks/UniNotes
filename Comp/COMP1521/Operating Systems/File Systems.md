A file system has multiple components:
- Files: a named collection of bytes
- Directories
- Metadata

## File Names
File names can take any byte except for \0 and /. Max file name is usually 255 chars.

. and .. are files in every directory and refer the the current and parent directory respectively

.___ refers to a hidden file which will generally not be displayed by default
