## Definitions
### Principle value
We define the principle valued complex logarithm as:
$$
\text{Log}(z) = \ln(|z|) + i \text{Arg}(z)
$$
We do this to preserve the property that:
$$
e^{\text{Log}(z)} = z
$$
But we are not able to preserve the property that
$$\text{Log}(e^z) = z$$
because $\exp(z)$ is not one-to-one.
### Other branches
We also define other branches by the formula:
$$
\begin{align}
\log_\theta (w) = \ln|w| + i\arg_\theta(w)
\end{align}
$$
where $\arg_\theta$ denotes the argument in the range $(\theta, \theta + 2\pi)$.
### Multi valued
We can define
$$
\begin{align}
\log(z) = \ln|z| + i\arg(z)
\end{align}
$$
Note returns a set not a value.
## Differentiability
We get that all $\log_\theta(w)$ is differentiable everywhere except the ray with angle $\theta$ and has the derivative
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dw} \log_\theta(w) = \frac{1}{w}
\end{align}
$$
