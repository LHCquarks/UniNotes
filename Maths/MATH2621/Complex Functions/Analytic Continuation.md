## Main theorem
Because all **holomorphic** functions can be written as a power series, and for all power series, if two share the same values on a line of points then they are the exact same power series, we get the theorem:

If two **holomorphic** functions share the same values along a line then they are the same functions.

## Side theorem
Similar to the main theorem, if we have a function $f \in \text H(\Omega)$ and $f(z) = 0: z \in \Upsilon$ where $\Upsilon$ is a nonempty *open subset* of $\Omega$ then:
$f(z) = 0: z \in \Omega$

Which means that any two functions that share values on a given region are the same function **everywhere**
