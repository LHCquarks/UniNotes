## Why sketching complex functions is hard
For a complex function $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ we have 2 dimensions (real and imaginary) for the input space and 2 dimensions for the output space (real and imaginary).
In total this is 4 dimensions to plot!

All these extra dimensions means we can not plot the function in the same ways in which we did before so instead we use the different techniques bellow.
## Terminology
For a function $w = f(z)$ we say that the input space of the function is called the z-plane and the output space as the w-plane
## Curve mapping
### Method
For a function $w = f(z)$ we can plot elementary curves in the z-plane such as:
- lines parallel to the axes
- concentric circles around the origin
- rays exiting from the origin
We then examine how these curves bend and warp as they are transferred into the function and study the shapes these curves have turned into in the w-plane

We can also do this exact same processes by instead plotting elementary curves in the w-plane and observing how these transform into the z-plane

Sometimes to save space we only draw the w-plane and label the curves to show where they came from
### Pros
It gives a sufficient representation that gives an idea of how it transforms
### Cons
It uses a lot of space and may be ambiguous

## Level curves
### Method
Level curves work on the same principle as Curve mapping but instead of transforming elementary curves in the z-plane into the w-plane we transform elementary curves in the w-plane into the z-plane

Note: This is the same thing as sketching the inverse function with the Curve mapping method
### Pros
Can help to highlight the symmetries of the function
### Cons
Shows the inverse function more than the regular function
