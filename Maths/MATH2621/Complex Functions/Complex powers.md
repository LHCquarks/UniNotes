To define complex powers we make use of exponentials and logarithms.
For some $z, \alpha \in \mathbb C$ we write the multi valued function
$$
\begin{align}
z^\alpha = \exp(\alpha\log(z))
\end{align}
$$
Or for the principle branch we write
$$
\begin{align}
\text{PV } z^\alpha = \exp(\alpha\text{Log}(z))
\end{align}
$$
