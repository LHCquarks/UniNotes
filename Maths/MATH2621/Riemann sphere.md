To properly define $\infty$ in the complex plane we we define a sphere centered around 0.

We then project a point onto this sphere by taking the point at the north pole of the sphere and connecting it to a point on the complex plane. Then the intersection of this line and the sphere becomes the position of the point on the Riemann sphere.

Thus the point at the north pole is $\infty$
