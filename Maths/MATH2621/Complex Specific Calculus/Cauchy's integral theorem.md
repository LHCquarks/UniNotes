## Theorem
Suppose that $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain, that $f\in H(\Omega)$, and that $\Gamma$ is a closed contour $\Omega$. Then:
$$
\begin{align}
\int_\Gamma f(z) dz = 0
\end{align}
$$
## Corollary
### Same end point curves
Suppose that we now have 2 contours that share the same start and end points $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ then
$$
\begin{align}
\int_{\Gamma\sqcup\Delta^*} f(z)dz = \int_\Gamma f(z)dz - \int_\Delta f(z)dz
\end{align}
$$
### Existence of primitives
Suppose we have the contour integral and a **Holomorphic** function $f$
$$
\begin{align}
\int_\Gamma f(z)dz
\end{align}
$$
Then there exists a differentiable function $F$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
\int_\Gamma f(z)dz = F(p) - F(q)
\end{align}
$$
